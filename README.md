# Analysis of Weather Using Spark

## Abstract
Air quality and humidity changes have global impacts. This project analyzes air quality data from Sofia and predicts humidity using Spark Streaming and MLlib. Linear Regression and Decision Tree models are used for live prediction, achieving up to 78% accuracy.

## Key Features
- Real-time weather data streaming and analysis with Apache Spark.
- Humidity prediction using ML algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Tree).
- Spark SQL for structured data operations.
- Efficient big data handling and scalable computations.

## Technologies
- Apache Spark (Spark Streaming, Spark SQL, MLlib)
- PySpark for integration with Python
- Sofia Air Quality Dataset

## How to Use
1. Set up Spark and load the Sofia air quality dataset.
2. Stream and preprocess the data using Spark DataFrames and Streaming.
3. Train ML models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree) for humidity prediction.
4. Evaluate and visualize prediction results.
