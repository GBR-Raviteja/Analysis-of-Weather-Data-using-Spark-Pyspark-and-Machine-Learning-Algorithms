# Analysis-of-Weather-Data-using-Spark-Pyspark-and-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This project analyzes weather—specifically, humidity prediction—using big data techniques with Apache Spark. Employing the Sofia air quality dataset, it streams, processes, and predicts humidity in real-time using Linear Regression and Decision Tree ML models, achieving up to 78% accuracy.
